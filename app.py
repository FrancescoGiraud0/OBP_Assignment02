        Life times and repair times are exponential.

        a. Calculate the fraction of time the system is up based on the following input:

        - failure rate (of components)
        - repair rate
        - whether components that are not used are in warm or cold stand-by (yes/no)
        - number of components
        - number of components for the system to function
        - number of repairmen

        b. Find the optimal number of components and repairmen using the following additional input (all per unit of time): 

        - cost per component
        - cost per repairman
        - downtime costs
